# TO DO:

1. Create a table for ingredients, the user should be able to look for recipes based on ingredients available. Probably creating a Search button would work the best for this one?

2. Create a table for hardware

3. Edit the code so it collects the the data from hardware and ingredients in their separated tables. I think we don't need to create tables for the cooking time or the cooking instructions, though. 

4. Define more columns in the recipes table, such as food allergy warnings and urls of the final product. To warnings, we can create a table storing this information and define, which ingredients are associated with which warning. For example, "this (id_ingredient) may cause allergic reactions. For URLs, just add any url searched on google.

5. Any ideas about implementing suggestions for optional ingredients and recipes?
