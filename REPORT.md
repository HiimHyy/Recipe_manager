# The Final Project of Databases: Food Recipe Management System

Created by: Lawunn Khaing, Jesse Sillman, Huy Tran, Tran Truong (ITMI22SP)

# Introduction

This report examines the application of SQL in structuring relational databases via PostgreSQL, complemented by a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate user interaction with the database. The application's purpiose is to catalog recipes along with their necessary ingredients, cooking hardware, and categories. This system not only allows for the storage and retrieval of recipe data but also supports features like recipe updating, deletion, and advanced searching capabilities based on ingredients and categories.

# Database Schema Overview

The database for the Recipe Management System consists of two main tables: `recipes` and `ìngredients`. These tables were created store and manage recipes and their ingredients effectively.

## Recipes Table

The `recipes` table serves as the core of the Recipe Management System. The following SQL Query was used to create the table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE recipes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    cooking_time TEXT NOT NULL,
    ingredients TEXT NOT NULL,
    instructions TEXT NOT NULL,
    cooking_hardware TEXT NOT NULL,
    category TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

As we can see, the table holds the following columns:

- `id`: A unique identifier for each recipe, generated by a sequence for auto-incrementation.
- `title`: The name of the recipe.
- `cooking_time`: The time required to prepare the recipe.
- `ìngredients`: A text representation of the ingredients used in the recipe.
- `instructions`: A text based guidance on how to prepare the recipe.
- `cooking_hardware`: Any equipment needed to prepare the recipe.
- `category`: The classification of the recipe (e.g. desssert).

## Ingredients Table

The `ingredients` table is linked to the `recipes` table through a foreign key relationship. The following SQL Query was used to create the table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE ingredients (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    allergens TEXT,
    recipe_id INTEGER REFERENCES recipes(id)
);
```

As we can see, the table holds the following columns:

- `id`: A unique identifier for each ingredient, generated by a sequence for auto-incrementation.
- `name`: The name of the ingredient.
- `allergens`: Any allergens that the ingredient may contain.
- `recipe_id`: A reference to the associated recipe in the recipes table.

This table has its own primary key, `id`, and a foreign key. `recipes_id`, which establishes a many-to-one relationship with the `recipes` table since each recipe can have multiple ingredients.
